# Hi there 👋 I'm Anuradha Sahu

## 👩‍💻 About Me
I’m a researcher in **Scientific Machine Learning, Numerical Analysis, and Quantitative Finance**, passionate about developing advanced numerical schemes for nonlinear PDEs and designing specialized time series prediction models for financial data.

My work combines **mathematics, statistics, and machine learning** to build robust, adaptive, and data-driven algorithms that extract meaningful insights from complex systems. I enjoy bridging classical numerical methods with modern AI to create efficient and intelligent computational solvers.
